## 🚀Project Overview
**Campus Compass** 🧭 is a **fully GUI-based, Object-Oriented Java application** developed by **Tech Tutors** 💻 to provide **complete campus navigation** for the University of Ghana 🎓.  
With **Swing GUI**, users can interactively select starting points, destinations, and landmarks via **dropdowns and buttons**, while the system computes **optimal routes** considering:  
- Shortest distance 🏃
- Traffic Conditions🚦
- Accessibility ♿
- Weather Conditions 🌤️

  This makes the system **user-friendly, interactive, and practical**, while demonstrating **real-world OOP design principles**.
